# IBS
An island biodiversity simulator. Simulates change in species richness of a taxon according to the Equilibrium Theory of Biodiversity, introduced by Mc Arthur and Wilson in 1963.The theory assumes that the amount of species in an island depends on migration and extinction rates, wich eventually come to an equilibrium.

This program simulates multiple archipelagos with a set number of islands and how species richness changes with time, assuming species migrate from a source population that can either be a mainland or another archipelago island. From the original ETIB, extintion becomes higher with increasing species richness, whereas migration becomes lower, until an equilibrium is reached.
